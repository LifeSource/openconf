         A developer's conference or any conference for that matter is useless without speakers, no I don't mean the machinery with surround sound but the people who are assembled at the event. Openconf cares about the developers and community so we try to assemble the most talented and diverse set of speakers, from framework evangelist to your JavaScript geek. No one should feel left out at our events, if you did then we have failed as an organiser.
